# Agent-Steered SDLC

Agent-Steered SDLC is a set of reusable prompts, skills, and structural checkers for
spec-first software delivery with AI coding agents. It helps developers move from a product
request to requirements, design, planning, implementation, tests, and review without losing
traceability or skipping human review.

The workflow is intentionally artifact-driven:

```text
request -> spec -> design -> plan -> code/tests/docs/build/deploy -> assess
```

Each stage can be created, verified, reviewed, or assessed independently. By default, the
skill pauses for human input when important information is missing and pauses again after
generating an artifact.

## What You Get

- Slash-command prompts for specs, designs, plans, code, verification, review, and
  assessment.
- A native `agent-steered-sdlc` skill for agents that support skills.
- Structural checkers for specs, designs, plans, and code/test traceability.
- Installers for Windows, macOS, Linux, and WSL.
- User-scoped installs by default, with project-scoped installs when needed.

## Install

Run from the cloned repository root.

Preview the install without writing files:

```powershell
.\scripts\install.ps1 -DryRun
```

```sh
scripts/install.sh --dry-run
```

Install for the current user:

```powershell
.\scripts\install.ps1
```

```sh
scripts/install.sh
```

Install into a specific project workspace instead:

```powershell
.\scripts\install.ps1 -TargetRoot D:\path\to\product -Scope project
```

```sh
scripts/install.sh --target /path/to/product --scope project
```

Install only selected tools:

```powershell
.\scripts\install.ps1 -Tool codex,claude-code
```

```sh
scripts/install.sh --tools codex,claude-code
```

By default, Windows installs also refresh WSL targets when WSL is available, and WSL installs
also refresh Windows targets when `powershell.exe` is available. Use `-NoCrossInstall` or
`--no-cross-install` to stay in the current environment.

## Supported Targets

- **Codex**: installs the `agent-steered-sdlc` skill and direct prompt commands under
  `~/.codex/prompts`. Invoke direct prompts as `/prompts:spec-create`,
  `/prompts:design-create`, etc. after restarting Codex.
- **GitHub Copilot**: installs prompt files for VS Code Copilot Chat and first-class agent
  skills for Copilot CLI/agent surfaces. User scope installs prompts under the VS Code user
  prompt folder and skills under `~/.copilot/skills/agent-steered-sdlc` plus
  `~/.agents/skills/agent-steered-sdlc`. Project scope installs prompts to
  `<project>/.github/prompts` and skills to `<project>/.github/skills/agent-steered-sdlc`
  plus `<project>/.agents/skills/agent-steered-sdlc`. Copilot CLI does not treat prompt
  files as custom built-in slash commands, so the installer also creates direct stage skill
  aliases such as `code-review`, `code-verify`, and `code-assess` under the same skill roots.
- **Claude Code**: installs slash commands and the skill.
- **Gemini CLI**: installs command TOML files.
- **Claude and Pi**: exports prompt packs under `.ai-prompts/` for manual import or use.
- **Checkers**: installs `checkers/` into the target workspace unless skipped with
  `-NoCheckers` or `--no-checkers`.

Installed skill bundles are self-contained: each `agent-steered-sdlc` skill copy includes
`SKILL.md`, agent config, bundled `prompts/*.prompt.md`, and bundled `checkers/*.py`. Prompt
commands or stage skill aliases are also installed separately where host tools can expose
them directly.

Every dry or real install prints the destination folders before doing work.

## Commands

The prompt set uses four verbs:

- `create`: author or revise an artifact.
- `verify`: run deterministic/mechanical checks and report evidence only.
- `review`: make the qualitative adversarial judgment using available evidence.
- `assess`: run `verify` first, then `review`; this is the full gate.

The core stage names are:

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/spec-create` | Create or revise a Software Requirements Specification. |
| `/spec-verify` | Run structural spec checks and report evidence. |
| `/spec-review` | Qualitatively review spec quality. |
| `/spec-assess` | Run `/spec-verify` plus `/spec-review`. |
| `/design-create` | Create or revise a Software Design Document and ADRs as needed. |
| `/design-verify` | Run upstream spec and design structural checks. |
| `/design-review` | Qualitatively review design quality and upstream spec fitness. |
| `/design-assess` | Run `/design-verify` plus `/design-review`. |
| `/plan-create` | Create a breakdown or implementation plan with PR slices and touch sets. |
| `/plan-verify` | Run upstream artifact and plan structural checks. |
| `/plan-review` | Qualitatively review plan readiness, slicing, allocation, and sequencing. |
| `/plan-assess` | Run `/plan-verify` plus `/plan-review`. |
| `/code-create` | Implement a code-ready plan using Red/Green/Refactor TDD, including planned docs/build/deploy work. |
| `/code-verify` | Run tests, coverage, quality gates, build/docs/deployment checks, and structural code evidence. |
| `/code-review` | Qualitatively review code, tests, docs, build/deploy work, quality gates, and upstream consistency. |
| `/code-assess` | Run `/code-verify` plus `/code-review`. |

Exact invocation syntax depends on the host tool:

- Codex direct prompts: `/prompts:code-review`, `/prompts:code-assess`, and so on.
- GitHub Copilot CLI: stage names are installed as skill aliases where supported, so try
  `/code-review` or `/code-assess` after `/skills reload`. If the CLI surface rejects a
  stage slash name, invoke by natural language: "Use the agent-steered-sdlc skill to run the
  code-review stage."
- VS Code Copilot Chat: use the installed prompt file from the prompt picker, or ask in
  natural language with the stage name.
- Claude Code and Gemini: use their native command mechanisms.

## Workflow Model

Work is classified at three levels:

- **Product/system**: broad product or platform scope. Usually decomposable, not directly
  code-ready.
- **Feature/component**: one user-facing capability, subsystem, component, integration, or
  screen family.
- **Slice/change**: the smallest implementable unit, usually PR-sized.

Artifacts declare one readiness value:

- **Exploratory**: still being shaped.
- **Decomposable**: valid parent artifact, but needs child work before implementation.
- **Code-ready**: precise enough for implementation.

`/code-create` should only run from a code-ready implementation plan.

## Builds And Deployment

Builds and deployment are covered from the beginning:

- Specs capture externally relevant build, release, deployment, rollout, rollback,
  migration, smoke-check, and operational acceptance needs.
- Designs define deployable artifacts, build/package strategy, release workflow,
  environments, configuration/secrets, promotion, deployment topology, validation, and
  ownership.
- Plans assign build scripts, package manifests, generated outputs, CI/CD config, IaC or
  deployment manifests, migration scripts, smoke checks, rollback checks, and release docs
  to child work or PRs.
- Code creates and verifies the planned build/deployment pieces. It should run the build,
  verify the expected artifact, validate deployment scripts/manifests with dry-run or lint
  checks where possible, and avoid live production deployment unless explicitly requested.

Reviews stop with an upstream blocker when build or deployment intent is missing from the
artifact that should own it.

## User And Developer Documentation

Documentation is also covered from the beginning:

- Specs capture user and developer documentation audiences, tasks, onboarding, help,
  API/reference, examples, runbooks, troubleshooting, release notes, accessibility, and
  acceptance needs.
- Designs define the documentation architecture: source locations, generated vs. written
  docs, API/reference generation, examples, diagrams, publishing/versioning, ownership, and
  validation checks.
- Plans assign documentation work to PRs, including user guides, README/API docs, examples,
  runbooks, troubleshooting, migration notes, release notes, generated docs, and link/doc
  checks.
- Code updates and verifies the planned docs with the implementation. Public docs should
  match actual behavior and contracts, not describe unimplemented future behavior.

Reviews stop with an upstream blocker when documentation intent is missing from the artifact
that should own it.

## Human Gates And YOLO Mode

Default behavior is human-gated:

- If important input is missing, the agent asks one focused question at a time.
- After an artifact is generated, materially revised, reviewed, or assessed, the agent stops
  for human review.
- Downstream reviews stop when they discover upstream spec, design, or plan issues.

The human review pause is a hard gate. A completed spec does not automatically flow into
design; a completed design does not automatically flow into planning; a completed plan does
not automatically flow into code; and a completed code slice does not automatically flow into
the next slice or release/deployment work. The agent should end its turn with artifact paths,
readiness/status, verification/review/assessment results, open questions, and the
recommended next command.

You can opt into **YOLO mode** with phrases like:

```text
yolo
use your judgment
make reasonable assumptions
proceed without questions
```

YOLO mode lets the agent make reasonable assumptions and continue, but it must record those
assumptions, risks, and trade-offs. YOLO does not bypass readiness gates, planned touch sets,
quality gates, safety constraints, or the default review pause unless you explicitly ask for
end-to-end unattended continuation.

## Tests And Verification

Test responsibility is split by artifact:

- Specs define `AT-` acceptance criteria.
- Designs define the test architecture and lower-level test mix.
- Plans assign executable tests to PRs.
- Code writes the executable tests and implementation.
- Documentation, build, and deployment checks are assigned through the same spec/design/plan
  chain and verified during code creation, `/code-verify`, or `/code-assess` when planned.

Use `/code-verify` when you simply want a confidence run after a change: test suite,
coverage, pre-commit/equivalent gates, build checks, documentation checks, deployment
dry-runs or smoke checks where planned, and `check_code.py`. Use `/code-review` when you
want qualitative judgment. Use `/code-assess` when you want both in one gate.

The checkers provide deterministic structural evidence:

```powershell
python checkers/check_spec.py spec.md --json
python checkers/check_design.py design.md --json
python checkers/check_plan.py plan.md --spec spec.md --design design.md --json
python checkers/check_code.py --plan plan.md --tests-argv '["pytest","-q"]' --cov-min 80 --json
```

If `python` is unavailable, try `python3`, then `uv run python`.

The checkers do not prove semantic correctness. Assessment commands pair verification
evidence with qualitative review of requirements, design, plan quality, test quality,
implementation fitness, documentation/build/deployment completeness, and upstream/downstream
consistency.

## Repository Layout

```text
docs/      user-facing documentation and review notes
prompts/   source stage prompt definitions
skills/    native skill bundles
checkers/  structural verification scripts
scripts/   installers for Windows, macOS, Linux, and WSL
tests/     checker tests
```

Do not treat `.github/prompts` as source in this repository. It is only an install target
for GitHub Copilot project-scoped prompts.
