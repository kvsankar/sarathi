# Spec Review

Perform the qualitative review of a Software Requirements Specification. This command
judges the substance of the spec; it does not replace `/spec-verify`. If verification
evidence is absent, state that gap and either use the latest supplied evidence or recommend
`/spec-verify`. Use `/spec-assess` when the user wants verification and review together.

Target the spec file the user provides, defaulting to `spec.md`. Do not edit it unless
explicitly asked.

Use an adversarial posture: try to refute the spec, find missing stakeholder needs,
ambiguous behavior, weak acceptance criteria, missing non-goals, missing build/deployment
or documentation intent, missing logging/error-handling intent, context-driven concerns the
product likely needs, and traceability theater.
Prefer fresh context, a separate reviewer, or a different model/tool when available. If the
same agent created the spec, state that the review is not independent.

## Qualitative Review

Score each item 1-5 and give one concrete fix for any score below 5:

- Problem framing: mission, system boundary, stakeholders, success criteria, and root
  problem are clear before solution behavior appears.
- Stakeholder need fidelity: needs describe stakeholder goals and pains, not disguised
  implementation choices.
- Feature derivation and scope control: features trace to needs and avoid silent
  gold-plating.
- Non-goal quality: exclusions and deferred work are explicit and non-contradictory.
- Scope/readiness fit: scope is product/system, feature/component, or slice/change, and
  Implementation Readiness is realistic.
- Scope-specific completeness: the artifact carries the right level of detail for its
  scope, including build/release/deployment and user/developer documentation intent where
  relevant.
- Use-case quality: actors, goals, preconditions, flows, exceptions, postconditions, and
  actor value are behavior-focused and complete enough.
- Requirement quality: FRs are necessary, atomic, feasible, verifiable, unambiguous,
  design-free, and use "shall" consistently.
- Supplementary/NFR coverage: performance, security, privacy, reliability, usability,
  accessibility, interoperability, compliance, data, platform, operational,
  logging/telemetry, error handling, build/deployment, and documentation constraints are
  considered and measurable where applicable.
- Context-driven missed-concern scan: identify any performance, security, privacy,
  accessibility, compliance, resilience, migration, operational, cost, compatibility, or
  domain-specific review/test need implied by context but absent from the spec. If material,
  fail or block with the required upstream change.
- UX/presentation quality: UI-facing work has explicit expectations for baseline styling,
  layout, responsive behavior, accessibility, and readable loading/empty/error/validation
  states, or scopes them out deliberately.
- Mock UI preference: UI-facing specs record whether a mock UI is Required, Optional, Not
  needed, or Deferred; Required mocks include an explicit human approval gate before
  production UI implementation.
- Boundary contract quality: externally consumed API/event/file/SDK/CLI/webhook success and
  error shapes are defined when consumers or user-visible behavior depend on them.
- External system verification quality: material external dependencies name the real
  contract to honor and prefer acceptance criteria that can be verified against the real
  system or official conformance surface. If real-boundary testing is infeasible, the spec
  flags that verification risk; a primary integration seam cannot rely only on a mock/fake/
  stub story unless the user explicitly waives the risk.
- Logging and telemetry quality: required logs, events, metrics, traces, audit records,
  support IDs, correlation IDs, retention, and redaction/privacy constraints are captured or
  explicitly scoped out. When production performance or operations matter, APM expectations
  such as latency, throughput, error rate, saturation, critical spans, trace propagation,
  dashboards, alerts, and SLO/SLI signals are captured or explicitly deferred.
- Error-handling quality: UI, API, domain, integration, infrastructure, validation,
  authorization, timeout, offline, and unexpected-failure behavior is specified at the
  externally visible level or explicitly scoped out.
- Acceptance quality: acceptance tests are black-box, scenario-based, and verify linked
  UC/FR/NFR intent instead of restating requirements.
- Acceptance granularity: product/system `AT-` items may be broad acceptance intent,
  feature/component `AT-` items should refine bounded behavior, and slice/change `AT-`
  items should be precise enough to map to executable acceptance/e2e/API tests or justified
  non-code verification.
- Journey coverage: critical multi-step stories have `JT-` items that compose multiple
  `AT-` scenarios in order, carry realistic state across steps, and name observable final
  or intermediate oracles. If the product has long workflows but no `JT-` coverage, flag the
  gap or require an explicit non-goal/deferment.
- Traceability and change readiness: links support validation, impact analysis, and future
  revision.

## Output

1. Verification evidence considered, or a clear note that none was available.
2. Qualitative scorecard.
3. Top fixes ranked by impact.
4. **Review verdict**: Pass / Pass-with-fixes / Needs rework.

After reporting the verdict, stop. Do not start `/design-create` or any downstream command
without explicit user approval.
