# Agent-Steered SDLC

Use the installed stage command, prompt, or skill when the host supports one. If a stage is
not directly invokable, use this skill bundle's `prompts/*.prompt.md` files and follow the
matching prompt exactly. If bundled prompts are unavailable, locate this repository's
`prompts/*.prompt.md` as a fallback.

GitHub Copilot CLI note: prompt files do not become arbitrary built-in CLI slash commands.
The installer creates direct stage skill aliases such as `spec-create`, `code-review`, and
`code-assess` so Copilot CLI can invoke `/code-review` where skill slash invocation is
supported. If the CLI surface rejects a stage slash name, ask in natural language instead:
"Use the agent-steered-sdlc skill to run the code-review stage."

Command verbs have distinct meanings:

- `create`: author or revise the artifact.
- `verify`: collect deterministic/mechanical evidence only.
- `review`: make the qualitative adversarial judgment using available evidence.
- `assess`: run `verify` first, then `review`; this is the full gate.

## Workflow

Select the narrowest command that matches the user's current artifact:

- `/spec-create`: create or revise `spec.md`, including product/system,
  feature/component, and slice/change specs.
- `/spec-verify`: run structural spec checks and report evidence.
- `/spec-review`: qualitatively review requirements and stop if the spec has material issues.
- `/spec-assess`: run `/spec-verify` plus `/spec-review` as the full spec gate.
- `/design-create`: create or revise `design.md`, diagrams, and ADRs from the spec.
- `/design-verify`: run upstream spec and design structural checks.
- `/design-review`: qualitatively review design and stop if upstream spec ambiguity or design risk blocks safe progress.
- `/design-assess`: run `/design-verify` plus `/design-review` as the full design gate.
- `/plan-create`: create `plan.md`, planned touch sets, PR slices, TDD order, and worktree/parallel-work guidance.
- `/plan-verify`: run upstream artifact and plan structural checks.
- `/plan-review`: qualitatively review plan and stop if spec/design issues or planned scope issues block implementation.
- `/plan-assess`: run `/plan-verify` plus `/plan-review` as the full plan gate.
- `/code-create`: implement within the planned touch set using Red/Green/Refactor TDD,
  configured quality gates, and planned documentation/build/deployment verification.
- `/code-verify`: run tests, coverage, structural code checks, pre-commit/equivalent gates,
  and planned build/docs/deployment verification.
- `/code-review`: qualitatively review implementation, tests, traceability, quality gates,
  and upstream consistency.
- `/code-assess`: run `/code-verify` plus `/code-review` as the full code gate.

When the user invokes this skill generally instead of naming a specific stage,
operate in human-gated mode by default. Choose and run only the next appropriate SDLC stage.
For creation stages, generate or revise the artifact, run the corresponding `*-assess` gate
when practical, and then stop for human review. Report the artifact path, readiness/status,
key open questions, and the recommended next command. Do not continue automatically to the
next artifact type unless the user explicitly asks for an end-to-end, unattended, or
"continue through all stages" run.

## Hard Human Gates

These gates are mandatory execution stops, not suggestions.

- After creating, materially revising, or reviewing a spec, design, ADR, plan, or code
  slice, **end the turn immediately after the status report**. Do not start the next
  downstream command in the same turn.
- A completed spec gates `/design-create`. A completed design gates `/plan-create`. A
  completed plan gates `/code-create`. A completed code slice gates the next code slice or
  release/deployment activity.
- The stop report must include: artifact path(s), readiness/status, review/check result,
  open questions or assumptions, and the exact recommended next command.
- Continue past a gate only when the user's latest message explicitly approves the next
  stage, for example "continue to design", "run design-create", "approve spec", or
  "continue end-to-end unattended".
- YOLO mode only answers missing-input questions. It does **not** bypass human review gates.
- Even if the matching `*-assess` command passes, stop for human review before downstream work.
- If a tool/runtime keeps planning downstream work after a gate, ignore that plan and
  produce the stop report instead.

Also operate in input-gated mode by default. If important information is missing before
creating or revising a spec, design, plan, or code slice, pause and ask one focused question
at a time rather than silently filling the gap. The user may opt into **YOLO mode** with
phrases such as "yolo", "use your judgment", "make reasonable assumptions", or "proceed
without questions". In YOLO mode, continue with the agent's best decisions, clearly record
assumptions and trade-offs in the artifact/report, and call out any assumptions that need
later confirmation. YOLO mode delegates input decisions; it does not bypass readiness gates,
planned touch sets, upstream-blocker stops, safety constraints, or the default human-review
pause after an artifact unless the user also explicitly asks for end-to-end continuation.

## Operating Rules

- Preserve the spec-first order: spec, spec assess, design, design assess, plan,
  plan assess, code, code assess.
- After creating or materially revising any spec, design, ADR, plan, code slice, or review
  report, pause for human review before starting the next downstream stage. The pause is a
  hard collaboration boundary, even when the generated artifact passes mechanical checks.
- Use the three-scope model: product/system, feature/component, slice/change. Every artifact
  should declare Implementation Readiness as Exploratory, Decomposable, or Code-ready.
  Parent artifacts may pass as Decomposable; `/code-create` must only proceed from a
  code-ready implementation plan for a slice/change or sufficiently small feature/component.
- Use slug-only IDs. Specs and plans use `KIND-AREA-NAME`, for example
  `FR-AUTH-SIGNIN`, `AT-AUTH-SIGNIN`, and `PR-AUTH-SIGNIN`. Design entities use
  `KIND-SLUG`, for example `COMP-AUTH` and `IFACE-AUTH`. Numeric suffixes such as
  `FR-AUTH-10` are invalid.
- Infer the likely scope from the user's request and state it explicitly. Broad
  product/platform/app requests map to product/system, one capability/subsystem maps to
  feature/component, and bug fixes, PR-sized changes, or local behavior deltas map to
  slice/change. Ask only when the mapping is ambiguous or materially changes the artifact.
- Apply the artifact matrix:
  - Product/system spec carries mission, stakeholders, boundary, product needs, non-goals,
    major capabilities, representative use cases, major NFRs, build/release/deployment
    expectations, user/developer documentation expectations, broad acceptance intent, and
    child-artifact needs; design carries HLD context, major containers/services/modules,
    drivers, boundaries, data ownership, quality tactics, build/package/release strategy,
    deployment/operations, documentation strategy, ADRs, risks, and decomposition
    candidates; plan is normally a Breakdown plan with feature/component `WORK-` items,
    dependencies, child artifact needs, build/deployment tracks, documentation tracks,
    parallel tracks, and readiness targets.
  - Feature/component spec carries parent references, local behavior, FR/NFR/AT coverage,
    edge cases, build/deployment constraints, documentation constraints, dependencies, and
    non-goals; design carries responsibilities, contracts, local state/data, runtime flows,
    core/shell split, dependencies, build/deployment impacts, documentation impacts,
    decisions, risks, and test matrix; plan carries child slice/change work or PRs,
    integration order, test allocation, build/deployment allocation, documentation
    allocation, and touch-scope risks.
  - Slice/change spec carries the exact requirement delta, parent IDs refined/preserved,
    changed/unchanged behavior, documentation deltas, and acceptance criteria; design
    carries LLD-level local changes, API/schema/data deltas, failure paths,
    validation/policy logic, build/deployment script or artifact changes, documentation
    changes, migration/rollback, side effects, test levels/doubles, and likely touch candidates;
    plan carries concrete `PR-` items, Planned Touch Sets, Red/Green steps, test levels,
    LOC estimates, quality gates, build/deployment verification, documentation checks,
    rollback, dependencies, and worktree guidance.
- Treat test ownership as part of artifact ownership: specs define `AT-` acceptance
  criteria; designs define the test architecture and lower-level test mix; plans assign
  executable test levels to PRs; code writes acceptance tests plus the planned lower-level
  tests using TDD.
- Treat build and deployment ownership as part of artifact ownership: specs define
  externally relevant build/release/deployment needs or non-goals; designs define artifact,
  package, release, environment, deployment, validation, smoke, and rollback strategy; plans
  assign build/deployment files and checks to work items or PRs; code runs the planned build
  and deployment validation, without live production deployment unless explicitly requested.
- Treat user and developer documentation ownership as part of artifact ownership: specs
  define documentation audiences, needs, acceptance criteria, or non-goals; designs define
  documentation architecture, source locations, generated/reference docs, publishing,
  ownership, and validation checks; plans assign documentation files and checks to work
  items or PRs; code updates docs with implementation and validates them where practical.
- Treat downstream assessment/review as an upstream validation point. If design, plan, or
  code assessment/review reveals a latent issue in an earlier artifact, stop and tell the user which
  upstream artifact needs revision.
- Use an adversarial review posture. Prefer a fresh context, separate reviewer, or different
  model/tool when available. If the same agent performs creation and review, say review was
  not independent and actively seek counterexamples, traceability theater, and unverified
  claims before passing.
- When the platform supports sub-agents, split every assessment into two fresh-context
  sub-agent passes. The Mechanical Verifier runs deterministic/structural checkers and
  returns raw command evidence, metrics, IDs, and failures. The Qualitative Reviewer starts
  from the artifact plus mechanical evidence and produces the adversarial judgment,
  upstream blockers, top fixes, and verdict. If sub-agents are unavailable, disclose that
  limitation and keep the verification and review sections separate.
- Never stop an assessment at checker JSON. Apply the verification/review checklist:
  - `/spec-verify`: run `check_spec.py`; `/spec-review`: qualitatively review spec quality;
    `/spec-assess`: do both.
  - `/design-verify`: run upstream `check_spec.py` and `check_design.py`; `/design-review`:
    qualitatively review upstream spec fitness and design quality; `/design-assess`: do both.
  - `/plan-verify`: run upstream `check_spec.py`, `check_design.py`, and `check_plan.py`;
    `/plan-review`: qualitatively review upstream fitness and plan quality; `/plan-assess`:
    do both.
  - `/code-verify`: run upstream checkers, `check_code.py`, pre-commit/equivalent gates,
    and planned build/docs/deployment checks; `/code-review`: qualitatively review
    code-readiness, implementation quality, test quality, TDD evidence, scope fidelity, and
    gate fitness; `/code-assess`: do both.
- Use the lightweight track for spikes, throwaway prototypes, exploratory data/ML work,
  proof-of-concept integrations, or infrastructure investigations. Mark these artifacts
  Exploratory, timebox them, record goal/non-goals/risks/evidence/disposal criteria, and do
  not treat prototype code as production without follow-up code-ready artifacts or explicit
  user acceptance.
- Ask one focused question at a time when required information is missing. In YOLO mode,
  make the narrowest reasonable assumption, proceed, and record the assumption and its risk.
- Offer internet research for spec and design creation when current standards,
  regulations, platform behavior, APIs, or domain facts may matter.
- Keep implementation inside the plan's planned touch set. If code work needs files
  outside that scope, stop and ask the user to update or approve the plan.
- Run deterministic structural checkers after creating, verifying, or assessing artifacts. Prefer the
  checkers bundled in this skill at `checkers/check_*.py`; otherwise use the target
  workspace's `checkers/check_*.py` or this repository's `checkers/check_*.py`. Try `python`
  first, then `python3`, then `uv run python`.
- Treat checker results as structural evidence, not proof of correctness. The checkers catch
  missing sections, malformed IDs, orphan references, missing trace links, declared oversize
  PRs, missing Red/Green step text, unlabeled coverage output, missing same-test-block
  assertion trace IDs, oversize git diffs against the resolved review base, and obvious
  skip/TODO markers. Git diff-size and TDD evidence are required by default in code verify/assess;
  use allow-missing flags only when the repo cannot provide that evidence and the report
  states the limitation. Red/Green text, AT scenario shape, and commit-message TDD evidence
  are presence checks; they do not prove semantic correctness, test quality, or true TDD
  history. Qualitative review must judge those from artifact content, code, tests, and
  available review/git evidence.
- Configure and run language-appropriate local quality gates for code work. Prefer
  repository-native tooling and pre-commit hooks where practical. For code-ready work, also
  run planned build/package commands and deployment dry-run/lint/plan/smoke/rollback checks
  where available, plus planned documentation build/generation/link/readability checks.

## Checkers

Use the bundled or installed `checkers/check_*.py` scripts when present:

- `check_spec.py` for specs.
- `check_design.py` for designs.
- `check_plan.py` for plans.
- `check_code.py` for code/test traceability and quality gates.

If the scripts are missing, report that deterministic verification is unavailable
and continue with the qualitative review required by the matching prompt.
