# Agent-Steered SDLC

Use the installed slash commands when they are available. If the commands are not
installed, use this skill bundle's `prompts/*.prompt.md` files and follow the matching
prompt exactly. If bundled prompts are unavailable, locate this repository's
`prompts/*.prompt.md` as a fallback.

## Workflow

Select the narrowest command that matches the user's current artifact:

- `/spec-create`: create or revise `spec.md`, including product/system,
  feature/component, and slice/change specs.
- `/spec-review`: review requirements and stop if the spec has material issues.
- `/design-create`: create or revise `design.md`, diagrams, and ADRs from the spec.
- `/design-review`: review design and stop if upstream spec ambiguity or design risk blocks safe progress.
- `/plan-create`: create `plan.md`, planned touch sets, PR slices, TDD order, and worktree/parallel-work guidance.
- `/plan-review`: review plan and stop if spec/design issues or planned scope issues block implementation.
- `/code-create`: implement within the planned touch set using Red/Green/Refactor TDD,
  configured quality gates, and planned documentation/build/deployment verification.
- `/code-review`: review implementation, tests, traceability, pre-commit quality gates, and upstream consistency.

When the user invokes this skill generally instead of naming a specific slash command,
operate in human-gated mode by default. Choose and run only the next appropriate SDLC stage,
generate or revise the artifact for that stage, run the corresponding structural checks, and
then stop for human review. Report the artifact path, readiness/status, key open questions,
and the recommended next command. Do not continue automatically to the next artifact type
unless the user explicitly asks for an end-to-end, unattended, or "continue through all
stages" run.

## Hard Human Gates

These gates are mandatory execution stops, not suggestions.

- After creating, materially revising, or reviewing a spec, design, ADR, plan, or code
  slice, **end the turn immediately after the status report**. Do not start the next
  downstream command in the same turn.
- A completed spec gates `/design-create`. A completed design gates `/plan-create`. A
  completed plan gates `/code-create`. A completed code slice gates the next code slice or
  release/deployment activity.
- The stop report must include: artifact path(s), readiness/status, review/check result,
  open questions or assumptions, and the exact recommended next command.
- Continue past a gate only when the user's latest message explicitly approves the next
  stage, for example "continue to design", "run /design-create", "approve spec", or
  "continue end-to-end unattended".
- YOLO mode only answers missing-input questions. It does **not** bypass human review gates.
- Even if the matching review command passes, stop for human review before downstream work.
- If a tool/runtime keeps planning downstream work after a gate, ignore that plan and
  produce the stop report instead.

Also operate in input-gated mode by default. If important information is missing before
creating or revising a spec, design, plan, or code slice, pause and ask one focused question
at a time rather than silently filling the gap. The user may opt into **YOLO mode** with
phrases such as "yolo", "use your judgment", "make reasonable assumptions", or "proceed
without questions". In YOLO mode, continue with the agent's best decisions, clearly record
assumptions and trade-offs in the artifact/report, and call out any assumptions that need
later confirmation. YOLO mode delegates input decisions; it does not bypass readiness gates,
planned touch sets, upstream-blocker stops, safety constraints, or the default human-review
pause after an artifact unless the user also explicitly asks for end-to-end continuation.

## Operating Rules

- Preserve the spec-first order: spec, spec review, design, design review, plan,
  plan review, code, code review.
- After creating or materially revising any spec, design, ADR, plan, code slice, or review
  report, pause for human review before starting the next downstream stage. The pause is a
  hard collaboration boundary, even when the generated artifact passes mechanical checks.
- Use the three-scope model: product/system, feature/component, slice/change. Every artifact
  should declare Implementation Readiness as Exploratory, Decomposable, or Code-ready.
  Parent artifacts may pass as Decomposable; `/code-create` must only proceed from a
  code-ready implementation plan for a slice/change or sufficiently small feature/component.
- Infer the likely scope from the user's request and state it explicitly. Broad
  product/platform/app requests map to product/system, one capability/subsystem maps to
  feature/component, and bug fixes, PR-sized changes, or local behavior deltas map to
  slice/change. Ask only when the mapping is ambiguous or materially changes the artifact.
- Apply the artifact matrix:
  - Product/system spec carries mission, stakeholders, boundary, product needs, non-goals,
    major capabilities, representative use cases, major NFRs, build/release/deployment
    expectations, user/developer documentation expectations, broad acceptance intent, and
    child-artifact needs; design carries HLD context, major containers/services/modules,
    drivers, boundaries, data ownership, quality tactics, build/package/release strategy,
    deployment/operations, documentation strategy, ADRs, risks, and decomposition
    candidates; plan is normally a Breakdown plan with feature/component `WORK-` items,
    dependencies, child artifact needs, build/deployment tracks, documentation tracks,
    parallel tracks, and readiness targets.
  - Feature/component spec carries parent references, local behavior, FR/NFR/AT coverage,
    edge cases, build/deployment constraints, documentation constraints, dependencies, and
    non-goals; design carries responsibilities, contracts, local state/data, runtime flows,
    core/shell split, dependencies, build/deployment impacts, documentation impacts,
    decisions, risks, and test matrix; plan carries child slice/change work or PRs,
    integration order, test allocation, build/deployment allocation, documentation
    allocation, and touch-scope risks.
  - Slice/change spec carries the exact requirement delta, parent IDs refined/preserved,
    changed/unchanged behavior, documentation deltas, and acceptance criteria; design
    carries LLD-level local changes, API/schema/data deltas, failure paths,
    validation/policy logic, build/deployment script or artifact changes, documentation
    changes, migration/rollback, side effects, test levels/doubles, and likely touch candidates;
    plan carries concrete `PR-` items, Planned Touch Sets, Red/Green steps, test levels,
    LOC estimates, quality gates, build/deployment verification, documentation checks,
    rollback, dependencies, and worktree guidance.
- Treat test ownership as part of artifact ownership: specs define `AT-` acceptance
  criteria; designs define the test architecture and lower-level test mix; plans assign
  executable test levels to PRs; code writes acceptance tests plus the planned lower-level
  tests using TDD.
- Treat build and deployment ownership as part of artifact ownership: specs define
  externally relevant build/release/deployment needs or non-goals; designs define artifact,
  package, release, environment, deployment, validation, smoke, and rollback strategy; plans
  assign build/deployment files and checks to work items or PRs; code runs the planned build
  and deployment validation, without live production deployment unless explicitly requested.
- Treat user and developer documentation ownership as part of artifact ownership: specs
  define documentation audiences, needs, acceptance criteria, or non-goals; designs define
  documentation architecture, source locations, generated/reference docs, publishing,
  ownership, and validation checks; plans assign documentation files and checks to work
  items or PRs; code updates docs with implementation and validates them where practical.
- Treat downstream review as an upstream validation point. If design, plan, or code
  review reveals a latent issue in an earlier artifact, stop and tell the user which
  upstream artifact needs revision.
- Use an adversarial review posture. Prefer a fresh context, separate reviewer, or different
  model/tool when available. If the same agent performs creation and review, say review was
  not independent and actively seek counterexamples, traceability theater, and unverified
  claims before passing.
- When the platform supports sub-agents, split every review into two fresh-context sub-agent
  passes. The Mechanical Reviewer runs deterministic/structural checkers and returns raw
  command evidence, metrics, IDs, and failures. The Qualitative Reviewer starts from the
  artifact plus mechanical evidence and produces the adversarial judgment, upstream blockers,
  top fixes, and verdict. If sub-agents are unavailable, disclose that limitation and keep
  the mechanical and qualitative sections separate.
- Never stop a review at checker JSON. Apply the review verification checklist:
  - `/spec-review`: run `check_spec.py`, then qualitatively assess spec quality.
  - `/design-review`: run upstream `check_spec.py` and qualitatively assess spec fitness;
    then run `check_design.py` and qualitatively assess design quality.
  - `/plan-review`: run upstream `check_spec.py` and `check_design.py`, qualitatively assess
    upstream fitness; then run `check_plan.py` and qualitatively assess plan quality.
  - `/code-review`: run upstream spec/design/plan checkers and qualitatively assess
    code-readiness; then run `check_code.py`, pre-commit/equivalent gates, and qualitatively
    assess implementation quality, test quality, TDD evidence, scope fidelity, and gate
    fitness.
- Use the lightweight track for spikes, throwaway prototypes, exploratory data/ML work,
  proof-of-concept integrations, or infrastructure investigations. Mark these artifacts
  Exploratory, timebox them, record goal/non-goals/risks/evidence/disposal criteria, and do
  not treat prototype code as production without follow-up code-ready artifacts or explicit
  user acceptance.
- Ask one focused question at a time when required information is missing. In YOLO mode,
  make the narrowest reasonable assumption, proceed, and record the assumption and its risk.
- Offer internet research for spec and design creation when current standards,
  regulations, platform behavior, APIs, or domain facts may matter.
- Keep implementation inside the plan's planned touch set. If code work needs files
  outside that scope, stop and ask the user to update or approve the plan.
- Run deterministic structural checkers after creating or reviewing artifacts. Prefer the
  checkers bundled in this skill at `checkers/check_*.py`; otherwise use the target
  workspace's `checkers/check_*.py` or this repository's `checkers/check_*.py`. Try `python`
  first, then `python3`, then `uv run python`.
- Treat checker results as structural evidence, not proof of correctness. The checkers catch
  missing sections, malformed IDs, orphan references, missing trace links, declared oversize
  PRs, missing Red/Green step text, unlabeled coverage output, missing same-test-block
  assertion trace IDs, oversize git diffs against the resolved review base, and obvious
  skip/TODO markers. Git diff-size and TDD evidence are required by default in code review;
  use allow-missing flags only when the repo cannot provide that evidence and the report
  states the limitation. Red/Green text, AT scenario shape, and commit-message TDD evidence
  are presence checks; they do not prove semantic correctness, test quality, or true TDD
  history. Qualitative review must judge those from artifact content, code, tests, and
  available review/git evidence.
- Configure and run language-appropriate local quality gates for code work. Prefer
  repository-native tooling and pre-commit hooks where practical. For code-ready work, also
  run planned build/package commands and deployment dry-run/lint/plan/smoke/rollback checks
  where available, plus planned documentation build/generation/link/readability checks.

## Checkers

Use the bundled or installed `checkers/check_*.py` scripts when present:

- `check_spec.py` for specs.
- `check_design.py` for designs.
- `check_plan.py` for plans.
- `check_code.py` for code/test traceability and quality gates.

If the scripts are missing, report that deterministic verification is unavailable
and continue with the qualitative review required by the matching prompt.
