# Spec Verify

Run the mechanical verification for a Software Requirements Specification. This command
collects evidence only; it does not decide whether the spec is good, complete, or ready.
Use `/spec-review` for qualitative judgment and `/spec-assess` for verify + review.

Target the spec file the user provides, defaulting to `spec.md`. Do not edit it unless
explicitly asked.

If the user is verifying a feature/component or slice/change spec that references a parent
product/system spec, add `--feature --parent <parent-spec.md>`.

## Mechanical Verification

Run:

```pwsh
python checkers/check_spec.py <spec.md> --json
```

For focused specs:

```pwsh
python checkers/check_spec.py <spec.md> --feature --parent <parent-spec.md> --json
```

If `python` is unavailable or fails because the launcher is missing, retry with `python3`;
if that is unavailable, retry with `uv run python`.

Report:

- Exact command executed.
- Raw checker JSON.
- Exit code.
- `passed/total`.
- UC and FR acceptance coverage percentages.
- Any uncovered IDs, orphan refs, duplicates, bad ID numbers, NFR unit issues,
  acceptance-test shape issues, or vague hits.

## Output

End with:

- **Verification result**: Pass / Fail / Unable to run.
- **Evidence limits**: structural verification only; qualitative review still required for
  problem framing, stakeholder fidelity, ambiguity, completeness, and acceptance quality.
- **Recommended next command**: `/spec-review` or `/spec-assess`.
